    <h1>When is a ranking actually defensible?</h1>
    <p>
      Most rankings look decisive because they print a neat order. The problem is that many scoring processes contain
      small, routine uncertainty. When two scores are close, that uncertainty can change who appears “above the line”.
    </p>
    <p>
      This page explains what “defensible” means in practice and how to test whether your shortlist cutoff is a genuine
      separation or just an arbitrary slice through a near-tie.

  <h2>Why ranking cutoffs are often hard to justify</h2>
  <p>
    A ranking is only as good as the scoring process behind it. In real decisions, scoring error is routine:
    different raters interpret criteria differently, data is incomplete, and judgments drift over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The practical failure mode is simple. You pick the top <strong>N</strong>. If the scores around the boundary are close,
    a small change can flip who lands in the selected set. The ranking still looks precise, but the cutoff is no longer
    something you can defend with a straight face.
  </p>
  <p>
    People often search for how to justify a ranking or defend a shortlist decision when scores are close. In practice,
    most ranking systems never test whether their cutoffs remain valid under realistic scoring uncertainty. That is why
    many rankings collapse when challenged, even if the scoring process looked rigorous.
  </p>

  <h2>The hidden problem: precision theatre</h2>
  <p>
    A clean ordered list invites you to believe that ranks are “real”. Usually they are not. What you actually have is a set
    of approximate scores with small errors, and a reporting format that hides those errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    When score differences are large, none of this matters. When score differences are small, it matters a lot.
    The harm is not abstract: strong candidates get cut, good vendors get dropped, and high-value projects are delayed
    because a near-tie was treated like a clear separation.
  </p>

  <h2>“But we still need a cutoff”</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. Decisions need boundaries. The point is not to avoid choosing.
    The point is to avoid pretending that a near-tie is a clean separation.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a cutoff falls inside a near-tie, you have three defensible options:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Use a tie band</strong> (treat a range of ranks as indistinguishable) and apply a secondary criterion.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve measurement</strong> (tighter rubric, extra data, calibration) and rerun scoring.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose explicitly</strong> (acknowledge judgment or constraints) rather than claiming “the ranking decided”.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The key question that determines whether a cutoff is defensible</h2>
  <p>
    A cutoff is defensible when it remains stable under realistic scoring uncertainty.
    In plain English:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>If the scores were slightly wrong, would you still pick the same set?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    RankSmarter operationalises that idea in two ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Deterministic boundary check:</strong> examines the score gap at the cutoff and tells you the accuracy required
      for that boundary to never flip.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sensitivity test (Monte Carlo):</strong> simulates many “plausible scoring worlds” within your error bounds to show
      how often the selected set changes and which items are effectively coin-flips.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Translation:</strong> this is not about “picking a number you like”. You are declaring a plausible error bound for your
    scoring process, then asking what your own data implies under that bound.

  <h2>How to test your cutoff in 60 seconds</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the tool: <a href="index.html"><strong>RankSmarter (local browser tool)</strong></a>.</li>
    <li>Upload your CSV with <code>item</code> and <code>score</code>.</li>
    <li>Set <strong>how many you are selecting</strong> (your intended cutoff).</li>
    <li>
      Set <strong>wiggle room</strong> to the largest scoring error you consider plausible for this process.
      If unsure, start higher. If the boundary is still stable, you genuinely have a robust separation.
    </li>
    <li>Click <strong>Run analysis</strong>. If offered, run the <strong>Sensitivity test</strong> for a more intuitive “how often does it flip” view.</li>

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>Are rankings ever objective?</h3>
  <p>
    Rankings reflect scoring rules and measurement error, not ground truth. A cutoff is only defensible if small errors cannot
    change the outcome at the boundary.
  </p>

  <h3>What does it mean if scores are very close?</h3>
  <p>
    It usually implies a near-tie. Treating that boundary as a hard line risks excluding items that are not meaningfully worse
    than those included.
  </p>

  <h3>Is this a statistical confidence test?</h3>
  <p>
    No. The deterministic check uses score spacing and a declared error bound. The sensitivity test uses simulations within that
    bound to illustrate practical instability.
